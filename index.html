        <p class="lead"> For this project, I want to raise awareness of JMU’s lack of accessibility for students and faculty members with physical disabilities and how the campus can be modified to alleviate issues that these students and professors experience on a daily basis. While there are many services that are already implemented specifically for physically disabled members of JMU, such as the Office of Disability Services and several accommodation services, this simply is just not enough, as there are still many problems that need to be resolved. These issues range from getting to specific locations on campus in time, to finding reliable parking, and traversing across JMU's hilly campus.</p>

                        <h2>Transportation Issues</h2>
                        <img src="parking.jpeg" alt="parking" height="250" width="250">
                        <p class="lead">One of the biggest obstacles that disabled students face is getting to class on time, which in turn leads to increased marked absences. JMU is a very hilly campus with a mix of terrains and elevation, which makes it very difficult for those with physical limitations to get to where they need to be in a timely manner. Parking is an absolute nightmare all throughout campus, and while there are some designated handicap parking spots, it doesn’t accommodate enough people. There needs to be more designated parking areas for them, as well as a transit system only for disabled students and faculty. </p>
                 
                        <h2>Specialized Bus System</h2>
                        <img src="jmubus.jpg" alt="bus" height="200" width="200">
                        <p class="lead">JMU's campus can be extremely difficult for students and faculty with physical ailments to get to their specific location in a timely manner. Having a lift system specifically designed to help those with physical disabilities get to campus will ensure they can get to their class without having to worry about parking and walking up and down hills. This can alleviate concerns about parking and traversing JMU's campus. </p>
                   
                        <h2>Modified Attendance Policy</h2>
                        <img src="classroom.jpeg" alt="classroom" height="250" width="250">
                        <p class="lead">JMU's lack of accessibility can significantly impact disabled students' attendance. Between the lack of reliable parking on campus, to the difficult walk to their class, these students receive unjust penalties on their attendance records.  Adjusting JMU's campus-wide attendance policy to allow these students more excused absences can alleviate the anxiety they face due to several factors including illness, stress, and medical appointments. </p>

                        <p class="lead">The University Rec Center here at JMU currently offers a wide variety of clubs and intramural sports for JMU students. However, these options are not available for students with physical disabilities. While other universities offer sports-related clubs and student-led groups, JMU currently doesn't have any organizations for those with physical disabilities that want to play sports. Having clubs and sporting events for these students is a great opportunity for them to get physical exercise as well as meeting other students. </p>
