                        <p class="lead"> During the summer of 2023, I participated in “JMU Ireland: Media Culture, and Society” where I got to work with other students to create and design a multimedia website. I designed the logo, font style, and color scheme for the site. </p>

                        <p class="lead">JMU's campus can be extremely difficult for students and faculty with physical ailments to get to their specific location in a timely manner. Having a lift system specifically designed to help those with physical disabilities get to campus will ensure they can get to their class without having to worry about parking and walking up and down hills. This can alleviate concerns about parking and traversing JMU's campus. </p>
                   
                        <h2>Modified Attendance Policy</h2>

                        <p class="lead">JMU's lack of accessibility can significantly impact disabled students' attendance. Between the lack of reliable parking on campus, to the difficult walk to their class, these students receive unjust penalties on their attendance records.  Adjusting JMU's campus-wide attendance policy to allow these students more excused absences can alleviate the anxiety they face due to several factors including illness, stress, and medical appointments. </p>

                        <p class="lead">The University Rec Center here at JMU currently offers a wide variety of clubs and intramural sports for JMU students. However, these options are not available for students with physical disabilities. While other universities offer sports-related clubs and student-led groups, JMU currently doesn't have any organizations for those with physical disabilities that want to play sports. Having clubs and sporting events for these students is a great opportunity for them to get physical exercise as well as meeting other students. </p>
